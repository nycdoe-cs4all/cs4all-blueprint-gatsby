              Critical computing is a 54-hour long introductory computer science
              (CS) course that provides students a chance to share their stories
              and better understand each other using critical thinking and
              computing. Students will study identity, or the social
              categorizations of people, to foster an appreciation for and an
              understanding of self, others and the power of diversity. They
              will examine how social categorizations impact computing systems
              and devices. In addition, students will explore CS concepts
              through Scratch, a creative computing platform, and use CS as a
              tool to advocate for marginalized communities.
