              The Introduction to Computer Science curriculum is based on the
              University of California at Berkeley CS 10 course, “Beauty and Joy
              of Computing” (BJC). TEALS has worked closely with UC Berkeley’s
              computer science (CS) department to adapt BJC as a flexible and
              approachable introductory programming course for a wide range of
              high school students from diverse backgrounds. The course has been
              successfully implemented in hundreds of high schools nationwide.
              This introductory computer science course is not the same as the
              BJC AP CS Principles course. The two courses share a pedagogical
              philosophy, as well as the Snap! programming environment.
