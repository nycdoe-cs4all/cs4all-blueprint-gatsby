              Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS)-A is a fullÂ­-year, college-level course
              that allows students to deepen their understanding of computer
              science concepts. The AP CS-A curriculum covers problem solving,
              design strategies and methodologies, organization of data,
              approaches to processing data, analysis of potential solutions,
              and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course
              emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem-solving and
              design. Read more on the College Board's{" "}

              NYCDOE will prepare teachers to deliver the TEALS program AP CS-A
              curriculum. To help teachers build a strong base in Java, the
              object-oriented language used in CS-A, DOE is collaborating with
              Oracle Academy to provide educator professional development via
              the Oracle Academy training programs. These courses are focused in
              Java and AP CS A teachers are encouraged to register and attend as
              a means of supporting Java content knowledge. This training is
              available to teachers with previous experience in CS.
