            <p>
              The computer science lessons for the 2020-21 school have been
              modified to work in both a blended and remote classroom
              environment. Each lesson folder contains all of the resources
              required to deliver computer science education to your students.
              Lesson plans, digital handouts, slide decks, and more are
              included!

          <div className="article-content">
            <p>
              Computer Science and Me introduces students to the idea of
              computers and computing by posing questions such as “What is a
              computer?” and “How do computers work?" Students learn about the
              different parts of a computer and their functions (hardware,
              software). Students explore how computers work by identifying
              important aspects of computing such as algorithms, programming and
              abstraction in order to apply their new skills to a culminating
              final project. Teachers can choose to utilize an online project
              through the Scratch Jr. platform or an unplugged project that can
              be integrated into a content area.

          <div className="article-content">
            <p>
              Computing Through Time is a unit of computer science (CS)
              instruction that engages students in remixing and creating visual
              media using procedures on and off the computer. Students learn the
              basics of how computers function using data, problem solving
              strategies, and how to create using a visual programming language
              designed for pre-readers. Every activity gives students time to
              work hands-on, personalize their work, and be creative while
              applying CS practices and concepts.
