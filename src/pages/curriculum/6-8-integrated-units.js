              The computer science lessons for the 2020-21 school have been
              modified to work in both a blended and remote classroom
              environment. Each lesson folder contains all of the resources
              required to deliver computer science education to your students.
              Lesson plans, digital handouts, slide decks, and more are
              included!

              Innovative Programming introduces students in grades 6-8 to
              computer science concepts and practices through a mixture of
              unplugged and plugged activities using the Scratch programming
              language. Scratch is a block-based programming language that
              allows students to create stories, games, and animations while
              equipping them with the skills they will need to succeed in a
              rapidly-changing technological era. This unit delves deeper into
              the computer science concepts of algorithms, abstraction, and
              programming. Each lesson builds on the knowledge gained in the
              previous lesson; by the end of direct instruction, students will
              have created a Scratch project integrated with another subject
              area that demonstrates the studentsâ€™ understanding of both the
              core subject matter topic and computer science. The unit
              culminates in a Hackathon-style project where students will be
              challenged to design an interactive Scratch project in response to
              a specific subject matter challenge posed by the teacher.

              Learning to Program, Programming to Learn is a unit of computer
              science (CS) instruction that engages students in remixing and
              creating visual media using procedures on and off the computer.
              Students learn how computers represent and can transform data,
              problem solving strategies, the difference between algorithms and
              instructions, and how to collaborate on building projects using
              visual programming language. Every activity gives students time to
              work hands-on, personalize their work, and be creative while
              applying CS practices and concepts.
