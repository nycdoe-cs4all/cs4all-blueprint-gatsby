          <h3>2019-20 Integrated Unit</h3>
          <div className="article-content">
            <p>Innovative Programming introduces students in grades 6-8 to computer science concepts and practices through a mixture of unplugged and plugged activities using the Scratch programming language. Scratch is a block-based programming language that allows students to create stories, games, and animations while equipping them with the skills they will need to succeed in a rapidly-changing technological era. This unit delves deeper into the computer science concepts of algorithms, abstraction, and programming. Each lesson builds on the knowledge gained in the previous lesson; by the end of direct instruction, students will have created a Scratch project integrated with another subject area that demonstrates the students’ understanding of both the core subject matter topic and computer science. The unit culminates in a Hackathon-style project where students will be challenged to design an interactive Scratch project in response to a specific subject matter challenge posed by the teacher.</p>

          <h3>2018-19 Integrated Unit</h3>
          <div className="article-content">
            <p>Learning to Program, Programming to Learn is a unit of computer science instruction that engages students in remixing and creating visual media using procedures on and off the computer. Students learn how computers represent and can transform data, problem solving strategies, the difference between algorithms and instructions, and how to collaborate on building projects using visual programming language. Every activity gives students time to work hands-on, personalize their work, and be creative while applying CS practices and concepts.</p>
