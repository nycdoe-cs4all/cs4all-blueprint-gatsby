              Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science
              course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and
              engage with computer science as a medium for creativity,
              communication, problem-solving, and fun. With a combination of
              unplugged activities to engage students in logic and introduce
              basic concepts, students also use a number of digital tools to
              create projects like websites, games, and apps that include a
              physical computing component with Adafruitâ€™s Circuit Playground.
              The course features six units which can be done in a single
              semester or a full year, and resources can be found online to
              allow flexibility of in-class meeting time. The course is young,
              but a strong community of over 500 teachers across the United
              States participate in forums to help modify the course for a
              variety of diverse student populations.
