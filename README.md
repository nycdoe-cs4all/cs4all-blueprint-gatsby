# NYC DOE CS Education (CS4All) Blueprint

[CS4All Blueprint V2.0](https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/) using [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org)

By [@nycdoe-cs4all](https://github.com/nycdoe-cs4all)

Based on [CS4All Blueprint V1.0](https://github.com/nycdoe-cs4all/blueprint-learning-site)

### About Gatsby and React

Gatsby is a remix of the popular framework React. React makes it easy to create web apps using components.
Gatsby makes it easy to create websites with a light front-end framework and little to no backend. It can easily connect to data sources (such as WordPress), and is configured to work well with headless servers. Gatsby statically renders the site and the data shown/stored on it, which means it's super easy to publish anywhere online and makes for a very fast web app.

## TO DO

- [x] Port [Blueprint 1.0](https://github.com/nycdoe-cs4all/blueprint-learning-site) to GatsbyJS
- [x] Squash bugs so Blueprint 2.0 looks and functions identical to Blueprint 1.0
- [x] Organize folder structure
- [x] Improve code comments (_could probably improve further_)
- [x] Update Educator Resource layouts and structure
- [x] (_NOT FINAL_) Improve look of curriculum page(s)
- [x] (_NOT FINAL_) Include references to NYSED standards, 3rd party curriculum, and CS Leads resources
- [x] Update README
- [x] Create process for adding new Educator Resources via WordPress
- [ ] (_IN PROGRESS_) Improve site accessibility (i.e. translation, page structure, alt text, etc. Will require sub tasks)
- [ ] Improve stylesheets (i.e only import styles for pages that need them)
- [ ] Make site more modular (i.e make components for items that are used often)
- [ ] Launch Blueprint 2.0 (estimate May 1, 2021)
- [ ] (**OPTIONAL**) Change video hosting
- [ ] (**OPTIONAL**) Change site hosting

## File Structure

- _src_
  - This is where the main code of this website lives
  - _src/assets_
    - This is where images, videos, etc. are stored
    - When adding assets, make sure they are placed in the appropriate subfolder
  - _src/components_
    - Where components that will be reused are stored (eg. layout and SEO)
    - The temporary home for stylesheets (until site is made more modular)
  - _src/pages_
    - Where every page of the site is stored
    - The structure for each component is written out in `src/pages/boilerplate.js`

## For Posterity

### Converting CS4All Blueprint V1.0 pages into V2.0 Gatsby components

_Quick Note 1: You may not have to follow every single step for each component. It is possible that, for example, some files won't include comments or inline styling in the original HTML. In that case, move on to the next step._
_Quick Note 2: If, after following these steps, the page still does not work, use other pages as a reference or flag the file in some way for additional eyes._

1. Add the V1.0 page into `src/pages` and change the extension to .js.
2. Copy the contents of `src/pages/boilerplate.js` into the top of the file you're working in, and un-comment the code.
3. Change the title of the `<SEO />` component to the name of the page. eg. if the file is called `cs-and-the-city.js`, name it CS and the City.
4. Delete every line in the old HTML code that contains `{% %}`, such as: `{% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n %} {% block content %}`
5. Find every instance of `class=` and replace it with `className=` -- because React supports camel case, and lower case "class" means something different in the React DOM.
6. Find every `xlink:href=` and replace it with `xlinkHref=`.
7. Turn every inline HTML comment into a React comment. Replace the `<!--` at the beginning of every comment with `{/*` and replace the `-->` at the end of every comment with `*/}`. For example, `<!-- end of section -->` should be: `{/* end of section */}`.
8. Turn every inline style into a React inline style. In React, inline styling is done with nested objects, where every property is written in camel-case and every value is written in quotations. For example, `<h1 style="background-color: blue;"> Hi </h1>` becomes `<h1 style={{backgroundColor: 'blue'}}> Hi </h1>`. Instead of putting a semicolon between every property, put a comma.
9. Cut/copy all of the HTML code from the original site that you've just edited and paste it where the comment at the top of the file(the code you copied from the boilerplate) says "children -- the HTML code for the site".
10. Rename the component from `Boilerplate` to the name of the site, written in camelcase. For example, if the file is called `cs-and-the-city.js`, turn `const Boilerplate` into `const CSAndTheCity`.
